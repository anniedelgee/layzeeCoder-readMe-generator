# layzeeCoder-readMe-generator

## Abstract
A good readMe file goes a long way in getting the code community interested in your project. But this also takes some time out of the project schedule that could otherwise be spent building the application itself. This application uses ES6 and node.js to generates a readMe file based on user input. 

## Application Demo

## Usage

When building a web application there is usually limited time for writing documentation to accopany it, which doesnt mean that documentation is jsut as important as the project itself. this application can be used for streamlining the process  and makign sure you dont miss a step
