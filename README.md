# layzeeCoder-readMe-generator

## Abstract
A good readMe file goes a long way in getting the code community interested in your project. But this also takes some time out of the project schedule that could otherwise be spent building the application itself. This application uses ES6 and node.js to generates a readMe file based on user input.
